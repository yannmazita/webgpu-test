/**
 * Manages the generation of the cascaded shadow map (CSM) for the main sun.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This pass is responsible for rendering the scene from the sun's perspective
 * into a depth texture array. It is a depth-only pass and does not produce any
 * color output.
 *
 * The process is executed in a loop, once for each of the four shadow cascades.
 * For each cascade, it configures a render pass targeting a specific layer of
 * the shadow map texture array. The vertex shader (`shadow.wgsl`) then
 * transforms each shadow-casting object's vertices using its model matrix and
 * the unique view-projection matrix for that specific cascade. The GPU's
 * rasterizer then writes the resulting depth values to the shadow map.
 *
 * The resulting depth texture array is later sampled by the main PBR shader
 * to apply shadows to the scene.
