/**
 * Renders the scene's skybox.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This pass is responsible for drawing the environment cubemap behind all other
 * geometry. It employs a highly optimized technique that avoids the need for
 * any vertex buffers.
 *
 * The rendering process works as follows:
 * 1. A single draw call renders three vertices, which the vertex shader
 *    procedurally expands into a single triangle that covers the entire viewport.
 * 2. The vertex shader calculates the world-space view direction for each pixel
 *    by unprojecting the screen coordinates using the camera's inverse
 *    view-projection matrix. This ensures the skybox correctly rotates with the camera.
 * 3. Crucially, the vertex shader outputs a clip-space Z value of 1.0, placing
 *    the skybox exactly at the far clipping plane.
 * 4. When the render pipeline uses a `less-equal` depth comparison, this
 *    technique guarantees that the skybox is only drawn on pixels where no
 *    closer scene geometry exists, effectively making it an efficient background
 *    fill.
 * 5. The fragment shader simply samples the skybox cubemap texture using the
 *    calculated view direction.
